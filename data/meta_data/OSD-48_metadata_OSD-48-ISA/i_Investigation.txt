Study Title	Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse liver transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic and histology data
Study Description	Translating fundamental biological discoveries from NASA Space Biology program into health risk from space flights has been an ongoing challenge. We propose to use NASA GeneLab database to gain new knowledge on potential systemic responses to space. Unbiased systems biology analysis of transcriptomic data from seven different rodent datasets reveals for the first time the existence of potential 'master regulators' coordinating a systemic response to microgravity and/or space radiation with TGF-β1 being the most common regulator. We hypothesized the space environment leads to the release of biomolecules circulating inside the blood stream. Through datamining we identified 13 candidate microRNAs (miRNA) which are common in all studies and directly interact with TGF-β1 that can be potential circulating factors impacting space biology. This study exemplifies the utility of the GeneLab data repository to aid in the process of performing novel hypothesis-based research.

Study Protocol Description	A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subject to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in the identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Additionally, mice from the same cohort were used as basal control and vivarium control. Basal control mice were euthanized the day after launch as baseline references. Vivarium mice were housed in the standard vivarium cages for the same amount of time as spaceflight and ground control animals. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).	The flight group mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation. Liver was collected after spleen upon euthanasia for mice M21 and M22, and was frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C). For the rest of the spaceflight mice, the carcasses were frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth where disscetion was held. Ground control mice M31 and M32 followed the same protocol of on-orbit dissected animals (M21 and M22) and the livers were collected immediately followed by euthanasia. Rest of the ground control animals and all the basal and vivarium animals in this dataset have been dissected postflight per the protocol in the following.  Postflight dissection protocol: Mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues, including liver, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue.  Liver was preserved in RLT buffer or protein lysis buffer, homogenized and snap frozen with liquid nitrogen.	The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample—the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was “living”, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. Details of ISS dosimetry and a table with doses for all GeneLab ISS experiment ISS datasets are available at https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation.	RNA was extracted usign the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).	RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq strandard RNA library prep kit after mRNA enrichment (poly-A specific). The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.	The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform, three high output HiSeq lanes with 50 bp single end reads and index reads. 30 million reads per sample was requested. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.	Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0). Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8) and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports.	Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 96, genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0). Processing scripts used can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/GLDS_Processing_Scripts/GLDS-48/GLDS_version_11	For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8 M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered from Teknova, Hollister, CA. This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 volumes of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 volumes of cOmplete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. A piece of liver weighing between 20-30 mg was cut from each liver sample and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.	Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility in two batches, the first batch included spaceflight and ground control samples and the second batch included basal and vivarium control samples. In the first batch, the samples were divided into two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Group B consisted of ground control (GC) samples 21, 22, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, a pool of all NASA GC samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) GC samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples. Group C consisted of spaceflight (FLT) samples 2, 3, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, a pool of all NASA FLT samples, a pool of all NASA and CASIS (GLDS-47) FLT samples, and a pool of all CASIS (GLDS-47) basal (BA) samples. This labeling scheme enables comparison across NASA and CASIS specimen groups in the RR-1 study. CASIS FLT and GC samples were labeled separately as TMT 10-plex Group A (GLDS-47). In the second batch, the ten basal and vivarium control samples were processed in one TMT 11-plex labeling group along with one pool of all samples. TMT Isobaric label reagent lot number RE231321 (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/90110) SUMS protocol was followed: 50 ug were drawn from each samples defrosted on ice. The remaining sample was immediately placed back in -80C. 25uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C. 10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (~250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.	Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.	Proteome Discoverer/ Byonic Peptide Database: Uniprot mus musculus with isoforms. Raw files were converted into a .mzML file format using ProteoWizard 3.0.10875.	Histology on samples was performed by Triangulum Biopharma LLC (San Diego, CA) on archived tissues available from NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA). In brief, for each sample, one half was embedded in paraffin, while the second half was embedded in Optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) for cryosectioning. Paraffin embedded samples were sectioned at 4 um and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). OCT-embedded samples were cryosectioned at 5 um and lipids stained with Oil Red O (ORO). Whole slide imaging was performed in bright field using a Pannoramic Scan from 3D Histech (a Perkin Elmer Company). Raw files were converted to .tiff and .jpg files using QuPath (https://qupath.github.io/). There are multiple sections per slide, one section from each animal. The order of animal IDs in the file names corresponds to the sections from top to bottom of each slide image.	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a Molecular Cellular Imaging data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures/qualities). This enables all histology results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. In the transformation of the data sheet, Triangulum Task and Triangulum ID columns were removed as these are particular to the company who performed the histology. The remaining columns were left to allow efficient sorting by sample groups, dissection context, NASA ID, H and E File ID, and Oil Red O positivity staining percent.	DNA was extracted usign the AllPrep DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for DNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).	DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.	The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 100bp reads.	Merged fastq files were generated by concatenating the forward and reverse raw reads data for each sample into one forward and one reverse fastq file per sample. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and reports were combined with MultiQC (version 1.26).	Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7113 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/DEV_Methyl-Seq/Methyl-Seq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7113_Versions/GL-DPPD-7113.md). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.8). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus musculus Bismark references were built using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), with the Ensembl release 112, genome version GRCm39 reference (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus musculus Bismark reference using Bismark (version 0.24.2) and Bowtie2 (version 2.5.4), the aligned data were sorted with samtools (version 1.21), and alignment quality was assessed with QualiMap (version 2.3). Bismark (version 0.24.2) was used to deduplicate the aligned (unsorted) data, then methylation calls were extracted from the deduplicated aligned data, and bismark reports were generated for each sample with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Bismark reports for each sample were combined into a bismark summary report with Bismark (version 0.24.2). Alignment qualiMap reports and Bismark reports were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). A runsheet containing sample group information was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and imported into R (version 4.4.2), and methylation call data was imported into R using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Pair-wise differential methylation analysis was performed in R at both the base and tile level using methylkit (version 1.32.0). Gene annotations were assigned to the differential methylation results using genomation (version 1.38.0) and custom annotation tables generated using UCSC gtfToGenePred (version 469) and UCSC genePredToBed (version 469) from the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf (Ensembl release 112).	RNA was extracted usign the AllPrep RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 volumes beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was isolated using a scalpel and immediately placed in 800 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify  RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 uL H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios for all RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).	RNA methylation analysis was performed by Epigentek. Sixty samples of Total mouse liver RNA was prepared by GeneLab and received by Epigentek. The samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion, cDNA reverse transcription, library preparation, Bioanalyzer QC, KAPA library quantification, multiplex NGS on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and advanced data analysis. Bisulfite Conversion: RNA samples were bisulfite treated with the Methylamp RNA Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Epigentek Cat.   P-9003). 200 ng for the samples N1, N2, N4 through N12, and N37 through N60. 100 ng for the samples N3 and N13 through N36. Library Preparation: -cDNA was synthesized from bisulfite treated RNA and ligated with adaptors by using random probing method. -Library amplification was performed using indexed primers and library cDNA was purified with magnetic beads -Purified library cDNA was eluted in 12 uL of water. Library QC: Library construction was verified on a Bioanalyzer and KAPA Library Quantification.	The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 100bp reads.
